#the method for evaluating the A-listed companies according to the info in the annual reports
#firstly we use the data in 2016 to train the model
"""
1.choose some specific companies that have been performing well
2.Count the frequency of all verbs and nouns in these selected stock annual reports
3.Select the top 100 keywords
4.Count the number of these keywords in the selected annual report, forming an X data set in order
(we can add some cross terms to improve the fitting accuracy.)
5.Using the EPS in 2016 as the y data set to fit the above x data set, the coefficient k and the intercept b are obtained.
"""
#Then use the model to analyze all the data in 2016 fiscal year.
"""
1.Count the frequency of the above selected keywords in all 2016 annual reports to form the x data set
2.Use the k and b from above to predict y
3.Perform statistical analysis (z test) on y and average earnings per share. If the effect is good, proceed to the next step.
"""
#Then use all data in 2016 to train the model
"""
1.Count the frequency of the above selected keywords in all 2016 annual reports to form the x data set
2.Use the 2016 average EPS as y to fit x, and get k and b
(we can add some cross terms to improve the fitting accuracy.)
"""
#Then use all data in 2017 to train the model
"""
1.Count the frequency of the above selected keywords in all 2017 annual reports to form the x data set
2.Use the k and b from above to predict y
3.perform the statistical analysis of predictions and real EPS (z test)
